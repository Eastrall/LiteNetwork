`Sylver.Network` is a simple and fast networking library built with C# and the .NET Core Framework. It simplifies the creation of socket servers and clients over the TCP/IP protocol.

## Introduction

:information_source: `Sylver.Network` is a rewrite of my previous networking library named `Ether.Network`. This new version looks like the old one, but it has a better code structure, unit tests and performance improvements.

Just like the old version, `Sylver.Network` kept the same *"easy-to-use"* concept that allows you to create your own socket servers and/or socket client in a **few lines** of code.

## Features

### Server

- Server configuration
    - Listening host / port
    - Allocated bytes per clients connected
- Client management
- Broadcast messages to all connected clients or a given list of connected clients

### Client

- Client configuration
    - Remote server address / port
    - Allocated bytes for the receive and send operations
    - Retry configuration (One time, limited time, infinite)
- Connect to remote server
- Disconnect from the remote server
- Send/Receive messages to/from the server

### Packets

- Create packet streams
- Read data from packet streams
- Customize your packet structure with a packet processor

## Thanks

**Thank you** to everyone who has contributed to `Ether.Network` with features, bug fixes and suggestions to make the Ether library better! All contributions have been integrated to `Sylver.Network` (and reworked to fit the library design).
