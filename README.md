```sh
$> Install-Package LiteNetwork
```

Or you can use the dotnet command:

```sh
$> dotnet add package LiteNetwork
```

## Getting started

## Thanks

I would like to thank everyone that contributed to this library directly by fixing bugs or add new features, but also the people with who I had the chance to discuss about networking problematics which helped me to improve this library.
