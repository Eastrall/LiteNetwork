`LiteNetwork` is a simple and fast networking library built with C# and compatible with .NET Standard 2. Its main goal is to simply the creation of basic socket servers over the TCP/IP protocol.
It has been initialy developed for game development networking, but can also be used for other purposes.

```

Or you can use the dotnet command:

```sh
$> dotnet add package LiteNetwork
```

## Getting started

## Thanks

I would like to thank everyone that contributed to this library directly by fixing bugs or add new features, but also the people with who I had the chance to discuss about networking problematics which helped me to improve this library.
